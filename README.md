# Machine Learning Project

This project implements a basic machine learning framework, including utilities for dataset handling, neural network training, and optimization algorithms.

## Structure

- `Main.py`: Entry point for the project. Responsible for initializing datasets, training models, and evaluating results.
- `Neural_Network.py`: Contains the implementation of the neural network and its layers.
- `Trainers.py`: Includes classes and methods for training neural networks.
- `Util.py`: Provides utility functions and classes for common operations.
- `Data/`: Contains sample datasets for testing and training.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset using the `Dataset` class in `Util.py`.
2. Define a neural network using the `NeuralNetwork` and `Layer` classes in `Neural_Network.py`.
3. Train the model using the `Trainer` class in `Trainers.py`.
4. Evaluate the results using the provided metrics.

## TODO

- Implement the main logic in `Main.py`.
- Add more datasets to the `Data/` folder.
- Improve the optimization algorithms in `Trainers.py`.
- Add loggin and debbuging functionalities
- Vectorize even more the code
